Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab
Who is Captain Ahab sir
Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship
Clap eye on Captain Ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one leg
Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found
And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab
Hes a queer man Captain Ahabso some thinkbut a good one
Hes a grand ungodly godlike man Captain Ahab doesnt speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen
Mark ye be forewarned Ahabs above the common Ahabs been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales
Oh he aint Captain Bildad no and he aint Captain Peleg HES AHAB boy and Ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king
Captain Ahab did not name himself
I know Captain Ahab well Ive sailed with him as mate years ago I know what he isa good mannot a pious good man like Bildad but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a good deal more of him
So goodbye to theeand wrong not Captain Ahab because he happens to have a wicked name
Think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in Ahab
No no my lad stricken blasted if he be Ahab has his humanities
As I walked away I was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him
However my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind
Tell me when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab didst thou not think of Death and the Judgment then
Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of and how to save all handshow to rig jurymastshow to get into the nearest port that was what I was thinking of
Captain Ahab
Look ye when Captain Ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before
Step and growl growl and gothats the word with Captain Ahab
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab of that ship there the Pequod then let me tell you that I know all about the loss of his leg
During these days of preparation Queequeg and I often visited the craft and as often I asked about Captain Ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship
What CaptainAhab
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab when we heard a noise on deck
Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin
Captain Ahab is all readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shore eh
And as for Captain Ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin
Indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilots and as he was not yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore Captain Ahab stayed below
I hope yell have fine weather now so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among yea pleasant sun is all he needs and yell have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go
In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies
An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the worlds grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back
Ahab
For several days after leaving Nantucket nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab
Reality outran apprehension Captain Ahab stood upon his quarterdeck
But once Tashtegos senior an old GayHead Indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea
Yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey Manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of Nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab
So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to pass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood
His bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud Captain Ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ships everpitching prow
And not only that but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe
For as when the redcheeked dancing girls April and May trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so Ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air
Enter Ahab to Him Stubb
And all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on Ahabs texture
It was so with Ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks
Stubb thou didst not know Ahab then
Am I a cannonball Stubb said Ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion
Avast gritted Ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation
As he said this Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that Stubb involuntarily retreated
When Stubb had departed Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe
How could one look at Ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized
For a Khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab
With slouched hat Ahab lurchingly paced the planks
Ahab seemed a pyramid and I like a blazing fool kept kicking at it
But what was still more curious Flaskyou know how curious all dreams arethrough all this rage that I was in I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from Ahab
Captain Ahab kicked ye didnt he
In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garterknights of but be YOUR boast Stubb that ye were kicked by old Ahab and made a wise man of
Dye see Ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern
Ahab has that thats bloody on his mind
But Ahab my Captain still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me
Oh Ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air
From his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little Flask enters King Ahabs presence in the character of Abjectus or the Slave
Over his ivoryinlaid table Ahab presided like a mute maned sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs
They were as little children before Ahab and yet in Ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance
And when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked Ahab thereby motioned Starbucks plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection
For like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb
Had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say Ahab never forbade him
And had Flask helped himself the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it
Besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flasks official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at Flask through the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab
Now Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequods cabin
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages DoughBoys whole life was one continual lipquiver
In this one matter Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there
Nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially Ahab was inaccessible
And as when Spring and Summer had departed that wild Logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age Ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom
ENTER AHAB THEN ALL It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast Ahab as was his wont ascended the cabingangway to the deck
And so full of his thought was Ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement
The hours wore onAhab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect
Send everybody aft repeated Ahab
With bent head and halfslouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat
Good cried Ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them
But they were all eagerness again as Ahab now halfrevolving in his pivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus All ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale
While the mate was getting the hammer Ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him
Its a white whale I say resumed Ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale
Captain Ahab said Tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick
Moby Dick shouted Ahab
And has he a curious spout too said Daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick Captain Ahab
Captain Ahab said Starbuck who with Stubb and Flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder
Captain Ahab I have heard of Moby Dickbut it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg
Who told thee that cried Ahab then pausing Aye Starbuck aye my hearties all round it was Moby Dick that dismasted me Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now
I am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of Death too Captain Ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but I came here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeance
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it Captain Ahab it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market
To be enraged with a dumb thing Captain Ahab seems blasphemous
Are they not one and all with Ahab in this matter of the whale
But in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in
The measure the measure cried Ahab
In vain cried Ahab but maybe tis well
Once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and Ahab retired within his cabin
THE CABIN BY THE STERN WINDOWS AHAB SITTING ALONE AND GAZING OUT
Come Ahabs compliments to ye come and see if ye can swerve me
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay embattled bantering bow but only to drag dark Ahab after it where he broods within his sternward cabin builded over the dead water of the wake and further on hunted by its wolfish gurglings
I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall something as they burst a waterspout with a pistolfire your ship right into it
A wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me Ahabs quenchless feud seemed mine
In that way mostly the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded
That captain was Ahab
And then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him Moby Dick had reaped away Ahabs leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field
Small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devilAhab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it
All that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy Ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in Moby Dick
Yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling Patagonian Cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad
Ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated Hudson when that noble Northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the Highland gorge
But as in his narrowflowing monomania not one jot of Ahabs broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished
If such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength Ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object
This is much yet Ahabs larger darker deeper part remains unhinted
Now in his heart Ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad
But be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and allengrossing object of hunting the White Whale
What the white whale was to Ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread them before him on his screweddown table
But it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin Ahab thus pondered over his charts
For with the charts of all four oceans before him Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul
And hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate feedinggrounds could Ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting
And where Ahabs chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as Ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty
Yet the premature hour of the Pequods sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by Ahab with a view to this very complexion of things
And have I not tallied the whale Ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escape
For at such times crazy Ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this Ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again
But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in Ahabs case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of its own
Therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself
To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order
Starbucks body and Starbucks coerced will were Ahabs so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbucks brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it
Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing
The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought Ahab is sordidness
I will not strip these men thought Ahab of all hopes of cashaye cash
They may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier Ahab
Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally
From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself
For all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the Pequods voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession
Quick steward cried Ahab
DoughBoy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to Ahab
With a start all glared at dark Ahab who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air
While yet the wondering ships company were gazing upon these strangers Ahab cried out to the whiteturbaned old man at their head All ready there Fedallah
Hardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed Starbuck Stubb and Flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water
Captain Ahab said Starbuck
Spread yourselves cried Ahab give way all four boats
In obedience to a sign from Ahab Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubbs bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other Stubb hailed the mate
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and Stubbs confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahabs precise agency in the matter from the beginning
Meantime Ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tigeryellow crew of histhese were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foamglued lips Ahab leaped after his prey
Ahabs Boat and Crew
But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person
Whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahabs peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort of a halfhinted influence Heaven knows but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew
Walking the deck with quick sidelunging strides Ahab commanded the tgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread
And had you watched Ahabs face that night you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring
During all this blackness of the elements Ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mates
So with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whales name to another ship Ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings
Swim away from me do ye murmured Ahab gazing over into the water
The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms
This latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates
Bareheaded in the sultry sun Ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo
The four boats were soon on the water Ahabs in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey
But Ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following
Luff cried Ahab
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers
Darkness came on but three lights up and down in the Pequods mainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks
If moody Ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known on deck Stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still goodnatured excitement
A short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin
Speak thou vast and venerable head muttered Ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee
Well now thats cheering cried Ahab suddenly erecting himself while whole thunderclouds swept aside from his brow
I fear not thy epidemic man said Ahab from the bulwarks to Captain Mayhew who stood in the boats stern come on board
Hast thou seen the White Whale demanded Ahab when the boat drifted back
Mayhew having concluded his narration Ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale if opportunity should offer
To which Ahab answeredAye
Ahab stolidly turned aside then said to Mayhew Captain I have just bethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for one of thy officers if I mistake not
Canst not read it cried Ahab
Meantime Ahab holding the letter muttered Mr Haryes Mr Harrya womans pinny handthe mans wife Ill wagerAyeMr
Nay keep it thyself cried Gabriel to Ahab thou art soon going that way
Curses throttle thee yelled Ahab
It fell at Ahabs feet
Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab
And Ahab chanced so to stand that the Parsee occupied his shadow while if the Parsees shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen Ahabs
With a fair fresh wind the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands and gain the far coast of Japan in time for the great whaling season there
But how now in this zoned quest does Ahab touch no land does his crew drink air
So Ahab
Levelling his glass at this sight Ahab quickly revolved in his pivothole crying Aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the sailsMalays sir and after us
As with glass under arm Ahab toandfro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed his
Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shoutedNo Sir
Upon which Ahab retired and Stubb returned to the Frenchman
Some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahabs loud command to Stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye
Before this equatorial coin Ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing
The firm tower that is Ahab the volcano that is Ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is Ahab all are Ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magicians glass to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self
Ha ha old Ahab the White Whale hell nail ye
So cried Ahab once more hailing a ship showing English colours bearing down under the stern
Man my boat cried Ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near himStand by to lower
In the excitement of the moment Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moments warning
So deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain
It has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab
This was quickly lowered to Ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the running parts of the tackle
With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and Ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two swordfish blades cried out in his walrus way Aye aye hearty let us shake bones togetheran arm and a legan arm that never can shrink dye see and a leg that never can run
And he took that arm off did he asked Ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the Englishmans shoulder as he did so
Spin me the yarn said Ahab how was it
It was he it was he cried Ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath
Aye ayethey were mineMY irons cried Ahab exultinglybut on
But at his superiors introduction of him to Ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captains bidding
It was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and taking my advice Captain Boomer here stood our old Sammy Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmed captain addressing Ahab go on boy
My captain you must have ere this perceived respected sirsaid the imperturbable godlylooking Bunger slightly bowing to Ahabis apt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort
What became of the White Whale now cried Ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this byplay between the two Englishmen
Bless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried Bunger stoopingly walking round Ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this mans bloodbring the thermometerits at the boiling pointhis pulse makes these planks beatsirtaking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to Ahabs arm
Avast roared Ahab dashing him against the bulwarksMan the boat
But Fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to take the boats steering oar and Ahab swinging the cuttingtackle towards him commanded the ships sailors to stand by to lower
With back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod
And that fine gam I hadlong very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heelit minds me of the noble solid Saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if I ever lose sight of it
Ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaohs
Ahabs Leg
The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person
And indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood
Yea more than equally thought Ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy
For thought Ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduction
With many other particulars concerning Ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the Pequod he had hidden himself away with such GrandLamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead
Captain Pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed as touching all Ahabs deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light
And not only this but to that evercontracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualtyremaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by Ahabinvested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails
But be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly Ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedureshe called the carpenter
Ahab and the Carpenter
AHAB ADVANCING DURING THE ENSUING SCENE THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMES Well manmaker
But Ahab oh hes a hard driver
Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islandsNiphon Matsmai and Sikoke
Captain Ahab mistakes it is I The oil in the hold is leaking sir
What cares Ahab
Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto Captain Ahab
Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most SouthSeamens cabin furniture and pointing it towards Starbuck exclaimed There is one God that is Lord over the earth and one Captain that is lord over the PequodOn deck
But mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said Thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let Ahab beware of Ahab beware of thyself old man
He waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured Ahab as Starbuck disappeared
Whats that he saidAhab beware of Ahabtheres something there
It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting Starbuck Ahab thus acted
And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor QueequegOh devilish tantalization of the gods
With matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron about midday Perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an ironwood log with one hand holding a pikehead in the coals and with the other at his forges lungs when Captain Ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rustylooking leathern bag
While yet a little distance from the forge moody Ahab paused till at last Perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to Ahab
Because I am scorched all over Captain Ahab answered Perth resting for a moment on his hammer I am past scorching not easily canst thou scorch a scar
Look ye here then cried Ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hands on Perths shoulders look ye hereHEREcan ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou couldst blacksmith glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes
Why Captain Ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work
When at last the twelve rods were made Ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt
This done Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when Ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron
But as Ahab looked up he slid aside
At last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as Perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into Ahabs bent face
Pray God not that yet I fear something Captain Ahab
Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by Perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to Ahab to place the watercask near
Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled Ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood
Now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron
Pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harpstring then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings Ahab exclaimed Good and now for the seizings
This done pole iron and ropelike the Three Fatesremained inseparable and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank
Nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab
And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind some few weeks after Ahabs harpoon had been welded
And Ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others wakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene
Hast seen the White Whale gritted Ahab in reply
How wondrous familiar is a fool muttered Ahab then aloud Thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outwardbound
And as Ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings
For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by Ahab
Soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom Ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat
For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dyingthe turning sunwards of the head and so expiringthat strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before
These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was Ahabs
Ahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the Parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails
Started from his slumbers Ahab face to face saw the Parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world
The gallows ye meanI am immortal then on land and on sea cried Ahab with a laugh of derisionImmortal on land and on sea
The season for the Line at length drew near and every day when Ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ships prow for the equator
It was hard upon high noon and Ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude
Well that Ahabs quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through which to take sight of that solar fire
Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deck and with face thrown up like Ahabs was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness
At length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant
As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfthese passed over the mute motionless Parsees face
Unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till Ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted outTo the braces
Standing between the knightheads Starbuck watched the Pequods tumultuous way and Ahabs also as he went lurching along the deck
Well well I heard Ahab mutter Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that I must play them and no others
And damn me Ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it
Though lifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter boat Ahabs did not escape
Here cried Starbuck seizing Stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove
Old Thunder said Ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivothole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire
The rods the rods cried Starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux to light Ahab to his post
Avast cried Ahab lets have fair play here though we be the weaker side
Aye aye men cried Ahab
SUDDEN REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT AHAB WITH THE REST CLOSES HIS EYES HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM I own thy speechless placeless power said I not so
Ahabs harpoon the one forged at Perths fire remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboats bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire
As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpents tongue Starbuck grasped Ahab by the armGod God is against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this
But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon Ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropes end
Petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and Ahab again spoke All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old Ahab is bound
As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of Ahabs many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay
AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM
Didnt you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward
Not one ship in a hundred carries rods and Ahabaye man and all of uswere in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas
In compliance with the standing order of his commanderto report immediately and at any one of the twentyfour hours any decided change in the affairs of the deckStarbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breezehowever reluctantly and gloomilythan he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance
But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ships company down to doom with himYes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if Ahab have his way
Aye and sayst the men have vowd thy vow sayst all of us are Ahabs
On this level Ahabs hammock swings within his head this way
Long maintaining an enchanted silence Ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake
Upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause
Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger
As for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate
But as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahabs
But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet
Men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old Ahabs needles but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any
With a blow from the topmaul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck
At first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when Ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimedLook ye for yourselves if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone
In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride
But heedless of all this his mood seized Ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line
The Manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till Ahab advanced to him
Ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the old Manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak
But Ahab can mend all
Captain Ahab sir sir heres Pip trying to get on board again
The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered Ahab advancing
Here boy Ahabs cabin shall be Pips home henceforth while Ahab lives
Whats this heres velvet sharkskin intently gazing at Ahabs hand and feeling it
Steering now southeastward by Ahabs levelled steel and her progress solely determined by Ahabs level log and line the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator
Below in his hammock Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by Flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings
I make a leg for Captain Ahab and he wears it like a gentleman but I make a bandbox for Queequeg and he wont put his head into it
THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINETUBS BETWEEN THE VICEBENCH AND THE OPEN HATCHWAY THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS THE STRING OF TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FROCKAHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABINGANGWAY AND HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM
AHAB TO HIMSELF
But ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail Ahabs voice was heard
Throttling his joy Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descending her side
Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew
Where was henot killednot killed cried Ahab closely advancing
For Gods sakeI beg I conjurehere exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition
I take back the coat and watchwhat says Ahab
Meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab and Ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own
For YOU too have a boy Captain Ahabthough but a child and nestling safely at home nowa child of your old age tooYes yes you relent I see itrun run men now and stand by to square in the yards
Avast cried Ahabtouch not a ropeyarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every wordCaptain Gardiner I will not do it
AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW
Lad lad I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now
The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him
If thou speakest thus to me much more Ahabs purpose keels up in him
Weep so and I will murder thee have a care for Ahab too is mad
AHAB GOES PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD
As the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so Ahabs purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew
Alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of Ahabs iron soul
But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as Ahabs eyes so awed the crews the inscrutable Parsees glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it
At times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight Ahab in his scuttle the Parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance
And yet somehow did Ahabin his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinatesAhab seemed an independent lord the Parsee but his slave
For be this Parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid Ahab
Ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail
And thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and milesahead astern this side and thatwithin the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height
Now the first time Ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings
But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight
Your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind Ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them
Ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea
Not forged and snatching Perths levelled iron from the crotch Ahab held it out exclaimingLook ye Nantucketer here in this hand I hold his death
Up helm cried Ahab like lightning to his men
As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight the strange lifebuoy hanging at the Pequods stern came into conspicuous relief
Tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girls forehead of heaven
Sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old Ahabs closecoiled woe
Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity
From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop
Ahab turned
Forty years of continual whaling forty years of privation and peril and stormtime forty years on the pitiless sea for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep
Aye I widowed that poor girl when I married her Starbuck and then the madness the frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously foamingly chased his preymore a demon than a manaye aye what a forty years foolfoolold fool has old Ahab been
Why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or better is Ahab now
No no stay on board on boardlower not when I do when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick
But Ahabs glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil
Is Ahab Ahab
Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eyes in the water there
What dye see cried Ahab flattening his face to the sky
Ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other lookouts Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the topgallantmast so that the Indians head was almost on a level with Ahabs heel
And did none of ye see it before cried Ahab hailing the perched men all around him
I saw him almost that same instant sir that Captain Ahab did and I cried out said Tashtego
Soon all the boats but Starbucks were dropped all the boatsails setall the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and Ahab heading the onset
An hour said Ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazed beyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward
In long Indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all flying towards Ahabs boat and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries
Their vision was keener than mans Ahab could discover no sign in the sea
The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition
The bluish pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahabs head and reached higher than that
At that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped Ahab the first to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite
Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whales insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless Ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst
And though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways Ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape
Meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ships mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that Ahab in the water hailed herSail on thebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick and whelmed him for the time
Dragged into Stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white brine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of Ahabs bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubbs boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants
The harpoon said Ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one bended armis it safe
The eternal sap runs up in Ahabs bones again
At the well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone down Ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heardWhose is the doubloon now
In this way the day wore on Ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks
Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing Starbuck is Stubb reversed and Stubb is Starbuck and ye two are all mankind and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors
Dye see him cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread
Aye aye cried Stubb I knew itye cant escapeblow on and split your spout O whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trumpblister your lungsAhab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream
Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison
Why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried Ahab when after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard
It was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had Ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles
Aye breach your last to the sun Moby Dick cried Ahab thy hour and thy harpoon are at handDown down all of ye but one man at the fore
Unmindful of the tedious ropeladders of the shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and halyards while Ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from his perch
Ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up to his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong vision
But skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by a planks breadth while all the time Ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds
Seizing that opportunity Ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping that way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks
Caught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahabs boat
As with Fedallah the day before so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boats broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous days mishap
Aye aye Starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he will and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has
Aye and all splintered to pieces Stubbdye see itBut even with a broken bone old Ahab is untouched and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one thats lost
Nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being
What means that little wordWhat deathknell rings in it that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry
Ahab is for ever Ahab man
Tis Ahabhis bodys part but Ahabs souls a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs
But ere I break yell hear me crack and till ye hear THAT know that Ahabs hawser tows his purpose yet
And as mechanical muttered Ahab
Meantime of the broken keel of Ahabs wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as on the night before slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun
Dye see him cried Ahab but the whale was not yet in sight
Heres food for thought had Ahab time to think but Ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels THATS tingling enough for mortal man to thinks audacity
Even Ahab is a braver thinga nobler thing than THAT
Stand by to sway me up cried Ahab advancing to the hempen basket
Aye aye sir and straightway Starbuck did Ahabs bidding and once more Ahab swung on high
But at last some three points off the weather bow Ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mastheads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it
No such green weather stains on Ahabs head
Aye aye like many more thou toldst direful truth as touching thyself O Parsee but Ahab there thy shot fell short
In due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallops stern Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the matewho held one of the tackleropes on deckand bade him pause
Lower awaycried Ahab tossing the mates arm from him
But Ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then and the boat leaped on
See ye my boys hand on the hillCrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boats Mark well the whaleHo againdrive off that hawk see he peckshe tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at the maintruckHa he soars away with itWheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh Ahabshudder shudder
The boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsa downward pointed arm Ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow
Give way cried Ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in him Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven
The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving Ahabs almost without a scar
Lashed round and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the Parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab
Away mates to the ship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not Ahab is enough to dieDown men the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in that thing I harpoon
Ahab cried Starbuck not too late is it even now the third day to desist
And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish Starbucks face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval
And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip
They will last long enough pull onBut who can tellhe mutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on AhabBut pull on
As both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into a morass Moby Dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air
Ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead
Slope downwards to thy depths O sea that ere it be for ever too late Ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark
Oh Ahab Ahab lo thy work
Why fly ye not O Ahab
The hearsethe second hearse cried Ahab from the boat its wood could only be American
Diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yards of Ahabs boat where for a time he lay quiescent
Ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone
It so chanced that after the Parsees disappearance I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahabs bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern
