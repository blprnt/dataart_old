Assignment Brief
Section 1: Data & Aesthetic

Working with the NYTimes API (or another data set of your choosing) create a aesthetic exploration of the data. For the purposes of this project, the piece should be **static** (not interactive). Considerations of work in non-screen based media (print, sculpture, etc.) are welcome.
